# Smart_Field_System
Welcome to the Smart IoT System for Environmental Monitoring project! This application leverages IoT technology to monitor environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and water requirements for agricultural or smart farming use cases. Built with Streamlit and Plotly, it provides real-time data visualization and generates detailed PDF reports with embedded trend graphs.

# üìñ Project Overview
This project aims to provide an intuitive interface for monitoring environmental data collected from IoT sensors. Key features include:
      Real-Time Monitoring: Track temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and water requirements in real time.
      Data Visualization: Interactive trend graphs for temperature, humidity, soil moisture, water needs, and energy consumption using Plotly.
      PDF Reporting: Generate PDF reports with embedded graphs for historical data analysis.
      Energy Tracking: Monitor energy consumption (e.g., for irrigation systems) with visual trends.
      User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for a seamless web-based experience.
      The application is designed for users such as farmers, agricultural researchers, or IoT enthusiasts who need to monitor environmental conditions and make data-driven 
      decisions.
